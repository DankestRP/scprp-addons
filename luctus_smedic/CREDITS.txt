I did not create all of this addon by myself!

Main credits belong to:
  - https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/ultimate-gmedic
  - "Unnamed team cec05afc0db4"
  - Genzo

This whole addon is based upon the gDeathsystem / Ultimate gMedic addon from the gmodstore.  
I programmed all serverside and clientside logic myself but the bandages weapon base and the defib weapon base is from the original gDeathsystem.  
Ofcourse the models and sounds are also from the original creator, but they are used from the workshop.  

If the original creator wants this addon to be gone then please message me! I will remove it ASAP.
