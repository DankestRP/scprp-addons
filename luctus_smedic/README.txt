# Luctus_smedic

Warning: This addon is not thoroughly tested yet!

This is a minimalistic medic system based upon the widely used gDeathSystem / "Ultimate gMedic".  
It is a drag-and-drop replacement for the old addon.

Main changes and differences:

 - You actually die if you are killed
 - No custom corpse entity for ragdolls anymore
 - Your corpse can be shot and killed while you are "bleeding out" (aka. after you died you are bleeding out)
 - You can stabilize corpses by pressing E on them, giving them more time to be revived before they die
