# luctus_intercom

To make it work you have to set up the "box" that includes the whole foundation.

To set up this box fly (with noclip) to the lowest corner on one end of the map and say "!intercom1" in chat.  
Then fly to the other corner above the foundation (but not including the surface) and say "!intercom2" in chat.  
To now load this box as your foundation simply type "!intercomreload" in chat.

For a more visual representation of how this box should look like take a look at this wiki entry for the function that checks it:
