# Luctus Cleaner

## Setup

Please install the "PermaProps" addon.

Take the "Trash Spawner" weapon and spawn trash with leftclick.  
To make it permanent rightclick on the trash to permaprop it.  
To remove it (un-permaprop it) you can press reload (R).


## Usage

You spawn, as stated above, the trash spots on the map.  
You can then create a cleaner job with the weapon_luctus_broom weapon equipped and let it, with leftclick, clean up the trash.  
You can add custom rewards for cleaning up trash, like XP or money.
