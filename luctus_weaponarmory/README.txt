# luctus_weaponarmory

This addon is nearly the same as "luctus_weaponcabinet" but requires weapons to be unlocked with money first before you can get them for free.  
This was difficult to implement into weaponcabinet without changing a lot, so I decided to make it into another addon.

Weaponcabinet = Free-To-Get cabinet entity or Pay-To-Use NPC entity (either free2use or pay2use, no mix)
Weaponarmory = First pay-to-unlock, then free-to-use forever
