# luctus_weaponcabinet

This addon lets a player get weapons either for free via the cabinet or for money from the npc.  
It costs money everytime you buy a weapon from an NPC. If you want to have a "unlock with money once then free forever afterwards" feature then please use the luctus_weaponarmory addon.
