# SCPRP Addons
GMod LUA addons for the SCPRP gamemode

**Warning:** Do not change the Names of the SCPs. They have to be named _SCP(SPACE)Number_ for the systems to work.  

For most addons to work you have to add workshop items to your server workshop collection and to the download for clients. These workshop items will be linked for each addon below.  

## SCP 035
A simple mask entity that, if you press E on it, makes you SCP 035. If you die you leave a mask again, enabling the next person to put it on.
Necessary workshop items:

## SCP 999
Basically an orange blob that can heal people and makes cute sounds.
Necessary workshop items:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2310758051 (Sounds)

## SCP 457
A guy who burns and sets everything on fire near him. Use a fire extinguisher to make him not burn for 10 seconds. Fire Extinguishers can be placed from the Entities tab in the spawnmenu. If you press E on those you get a fire extinguisher. (Permaprop them on walls!)
Necessary workshop items:  
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104607228 (Fire Extinguisher weapon and model)

## SCP 173
SCP173 as everyone knows it. The sh_ file has the small config: every 5 seconds a player blinks 0.2 seconds if SCP173 is near them. Vision doesn't go through glass (so that researchers can't freeze it by watching experiments through the safety glass)
Necessary workshop items:  
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827243834 (Playermodel)


## SCP 049 (untested)
A doctor that kills people if he touches them. (kill-aura like)  
You can also mix ingredients and revive dead players with a random effect as your zombie. (SCP 049-2)

## Hand SWEP
This is a changed workshop addon. With this swep you can pickup items. I only removed the buggy and not working EMOTE system.  

## Surrender SWEP
This is a changed workshop addon. I fixed the non-existant Worldmodel and removed unnecessary SWEPs like dab.  

## SCP Names
This saves a custom name for every job that you play. If you change into a new job you have to enter a name for this specific job. If you then switch to that job again your name will automatically change. This enables you to have multiple "personas" on one server without manually changing names all the time.  

## SCP Code
This is a simple "Status" addon. Code: Green means "Everything is OK, do your daily stuff" and Code: Red means "we are all about to die".
