On client there is the "LuctusCodeChangedCL" hook, with the old and new code as the only 2 parameters.

Example code for changing the TV description if you are the job Hobo:

hook.Add("LuctusCodeChangedCL","hobotext",function(oldCode,newCode)
    if newCode == "red" and LocalPlayer():Team() == TEAM_HOBO then
        LUCTUS_CODE_CURRENT_TV = "You won't survive,\nHobo"
    end
end)

On server the hook for this is "LuctusCodeChanged", which gives you the player, oldCode and newCode variables.
